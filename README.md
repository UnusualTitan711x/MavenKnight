Battling skeletons in a dungeon and trying to go around a maze-like dungeon with locked doors 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players explore levels and defeat enemies as they go deeper into the dungeon.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
